## Overview
The goal of this brief course is to provide you with a fun introduction to the world of Data Science with Python.
- [Today's slides](https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/e/2PACX-1vTV_qYXjhfuYs8jZyLDddVCplamc4C9x4Q0s_o2SnFZVrJOqkzqDB7-9H0R0hBRaS5LHvbiaBV1JoCa/pub?start=false&loop=false&delayms=3000#slide=id.g5687274f1f_0_0 )

#### Here's what we'll be doing:
* Overview of basic Python and programming concepts
* Building a simple application using Python
* Playing around and break things



## Setting up your computer


#### Please set up the following:

* A web browser to see what we're working on as others see it (Recommend Google Chrome: [chrome.google.com] (http://chrome.google.com))

* We're going to use [Google Colab](colab.research.google.com) so you will need a Google account if you want to save your own copy.

Well... that was easy!


## What this workshop is

A super friendly introduction to Python No previous experience expected!

- This course is for absolute beginners
- Ask Questions!
- Answer Questions!
- Help others when you can
- Its ok to get stuck, just ask for help!
- Feel free to move ahead
- Be patient and nice


## About me:

Hello I'm [Winston Robson](http://linkedin.com/in/winstonrobson/). I'm a recent graduate of the Data Science Immersive here at Galvanize SF. After moving to the Bay Area in May 2018, I've been working as a REALTOR® with BHHS Drysdale Properties and learning Data Science. For fun I like to watch & attend academic lectures, play & stream video games to Twitch, and code. 

Reach out to me if interested in:
- breaking into the tech industry
- learning resources
- buying, renting, or selling a house
- meetup recommendations
- learning more about Galvanize
- giving me suggestions for events!
- being friends

## About you!

Give a quick Intro!

- Whats your name?
- Whats your background?
- Why are you interested in Data Science?



## What is Data Science?

Great question!

Different Companies and people will have different definitions for roles.


In general I like to broadly think of it as "Solving problems using data".


- Data Collection and storage
- Data Cleaning, prepping
- Analytics, Metrics, gaining insights
- A/B Testing
- AI
	- Machine Learning
	- Deep Learning


Understanding the business problem is important for each step above.

### Jobs in Data Science

- Data Analyst
- Data Engineer
- Data Scientist
- Machine Learning Engineer
- Deep Learning Engineer
- Computer Vision Engineer
- Natural Language Processing(NLP) Engineer
- Product Manager
- More!


### Who uses Python?

I would say most major companies using Data Science and machine learning.

Other Languages: Scala, R



#### Popular Frameworks and libraries to keep in mind


- Data Science
	- Pandas
	- MatplotLib
	- Tensorflow
	- Numpy
	- Pandas
	- NLTK
	- OpenCV
	- A BILLION MORE!


*Note*: if you're thinking of exploring data science with python look into using [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/) to manage your python and data libraries

[Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1c1Gg6oSIeHOW_5e_37EDW70yqKAO1dfC) is a awesome place to start as well without having to install anything!



## What we'll do!

We're going to:

- Understand a dataset
- Visualize the data in a meaningful way
- Use Machine learning to make predictions

For this we're going to use:

- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- ScikitLearn
